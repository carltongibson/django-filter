Using django-filter
===================

Django-filter provides a simple way to filter down a queryset based on
parameters a user provides.  Say we have a ``Product`` model and we want to let
our users filter which products they see on a list page.

The model
---------

Let's start with our model::

    from django.db import models

    class Product(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        price = models.DecimalField()
        description = models.TextField()
        release_date = models.DateField()
        manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(Manufacturer)

The filter
----------

We have a number of fields and we want to let our users filter based on the
price or the release_date.  We create a ``FilterSet`` for this::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        name = django_filters.CharFilter(lookup_expr='iexact')

        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['price', 'release_date']


As you can see this uses a very similar API to Django's ``ModelForm``.  Just
like with a ``ModelForm`` we can also override filters, or add new ones using a
declarative syntax.

Declaring filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The declarative syntax provides you with the most flexibility when creating
filters, however it is fairly verbose. We'll use the below example to outline
the :ref:`core filter arguments <core-arguments>` on a ``FilterSet``::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        price = django_filters.NumberFilter()
        price__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='price', lookup_expr='gt')
        price__lt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='price', lookup_expr='lt')

        release_year = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='release_date', lookup_expr='year')
        release_year__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='release_date', lookup_expr='year__gt')
        release_year__lt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='release_date', lookup_expr='year__lt')

        manufacturer__name = django_filters.CharFilter(lookup_expr='icontains')

        class Meta:
            model = Product

There are two main arguments for filters:

- ``name``: The name of the model field to filter on. You can traverse
  "relationship paths" using Django's ``__`` syntax to filter fields on a
  related model. ex, ``manufacturer__name``.
- ``lookup_expr``: The `field lookup`_ to use when filtering. Django's ``__``
  syntax can again be used in order to support lookup transforms.
  ex, ``year__gte``.

.. _`field lookup`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups

Together, the field ``name`` and ``lookup_expr`` represent a complete Django
lookup expression. A detailed explanation of lookup expressions is provided in
Django's `lookup reference`_. django-filter supports expressions containing
both transforms and a final lookup for version 1.9 of Django and above.
For Django version 1.8, transformed expressions are not supported.

.. _`lookup reference`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/lookups/#module-django.db.models.lookups


Common declarative problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are some of the common problem that occur when declaring filters. It is
recommended that you do read this as it provides a more complete understanding
on how filters work.


Filter ``name`` and ``lookup_expr`` not configured
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

While ``name`` and ``lookup_expr`` are optional, it is recommended that you specify
them. By default, if ``name`` is not specified, the filter's name on the
filterset class will be used. Additionally, ``lookup_expr`` defaults to
``exact``. The following is an example of a misconfigured price filter::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        price__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter()

The filter instance will have a field name of ``price__gt`` and an ``exact``
lookup type. Under the hood, this will incorrectly be resolved as::

    Produce.objects.filter(price__gt__exact=value)

The above will most likely generate a ``FieldError``. The correct configuration
would be::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        price__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='price', lookup_expr='gt')


Missing ``lookup_expr`` for text search filters
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It's quite common to forget to set the lookup expression for :code:`CharField`
and :code:`TextField` and wonder why a search for "foo" does not return results
for "foobar". This is because the default lookup type is ``exact``, but you
probably want to perform  an ``icontains`` lookup.


Filter and lookup expression mismatch (in, range, isnull)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It's not always appropriate to directly match a filter to its model field's
type, as some lookups expect different types of values. This is a commonly
found issue with ``in``, ``range``, and ``isnull`` lookups. Let's look
at the following product model::

    class Product(models.Model):
        category = models.ForeignKey(Category, null=True)

Given that ``category`` is optional, it's reasonable to want to enable a search
for uncategorized products. The following is an incorrectly configured
``isnull`` filter::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        uncategorized = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='category', lookup_expr='isnull')

So what's the issue? While the underlying column type for ``category`` is an
integer, ``isnull`` lookups expect a boolean value. A ``NumberFilter`` however
only validates numbers. Filters are not `'expression aware'` and won't change
behavior based on their ``lookup_expr``. You should use filters that match the
data type of the lookup expression `instead` of the data type underlying model
field. The following would correctly allow you to search for both uncategorized
products and products for a set of categories::

    class NumberInFilter(django_filters.BaseInFilter, django_filters.NumberFilter):
        pass

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        categories = NumberInFilter(name='category', lookup_expr='in')
        uncategorized = django_filters.BooleanFilter(name='category', lookup_expr='isnull')

More info on constructing IN and RANGE csv :ref:`filters <base-in-filter>`.


Generating filters with Meta.fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FilterSet Meta class provides a ``fields`` attribute that can be used for
easily specifying multiple filters without significant code duplication. The
base syntax supports a list of multiple field names::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['price', 'release_date']

The above generates 'exact' lookups for both the 'price' and 'release_date'
fields.

Additionally, a dictionary can be used to specify multiple lookup expressions
for each field::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = {
                'price': ['lt', 'gt'],
                'release_date': ['exact', 'year__gt'],
            }

The above would generate 'price__lt', 'price__gt', 'release_date', and
'release_date__year__gt' filters.

.. note::

    The filter lookup type 'exact' is an implicit default and therefore never
    added to a filter name. In the above example, the release date's exact
    filter is 'release_date', not 'release_date__exact'.

Items in the ``fields`` sequence in the ``Meta`` class may include
"relationship paths" using Django's ``__`` syntax to filter on fields on a
related model::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['manufacturer__country']


Overriding default filters
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Like ``django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin``, it is possible to override
default filters for all the models fields of the same kind using
``filter_overrides``::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        filter_overrides = {
            models.CharField: {
                'filter_class': django_filters.CharFilter,
                'extra': lambda f: {
                    'lookup_expr': 'icontains',
                },
            },
            models.BooleanField: {
                'filter_class': django_filters.BooleanFilter,
                'extra': lambda f: {
                    'widget': 'forms.CheckboxInput',
                },
            },
        }

        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = {
                'name': ['exact'],
                'release_date': ['isnull'],
            }


Customize filtering with ``Filter.method``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can control the behavior of a filter by specifying a ``method`` to perform
filtering. View more information in the :ref:`method reference <filter-method>`.

.. code-block:: python

    class F(django_filters.FilterSet):
        username = CharFilter(method='my_custom_filter')

        class Meta:
            model = User
            fields = ['username']

        def my_custom_filter(self, queryset, name, value):
            return queryset.filter(**{
                name: value,
            })


The view
--------

Now we need to write a view::

    def product_list(request):
        f = ProductFilter(request.GET, queryset=Product.objects.all())
        return render(request, 'my_app/template.html', {'filter': f})

If a queryset argument isn't provided then all the items in the default manager
of the model will be used.

If you want to access the filtered objects in your views, for example if you
want to paginate them, you can do that. They are in f.qs


The URL conf
------------

We need a URL pattern to call the view::

    url(r'^list$', views.product_list)


The template
------------

And lastly we need a template::

    {% extends "base.html" %}

    {% block content %}
        <form action="" method="get">
            {{ filter.form.as_p }}
            <input type="submit" />
        </form>
        {% for obj in filter.qs %}
            {{ obj.name }} - ${{ obj.price }}<br />
        {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

And that's all there is to it!  The ``form`` attribute contains a normal
Django form, and when we iterate over the ``FilterSet.qs`` we get the objects in
the resulting queryset.


Generic view  & configuration
-----------------------------

In addition to the above usage there is also a class-based generic view
included in django-filter, which lives at ``django_filters.views.FilterView``.
You must provide either a ``model`` or ``filterset_class`` argument, similar to
``ListView`` in Django itself::

    # urls.py
    from django.conf.urls import url
    from django_filters.views import FilterView
    from myapp.models import Product

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^list/$', FilterView.as_view(model=Product)),
    ]

You must provide a template at ``<app>/<model>_filter.html`` which gets the
context parameter ``filter``.  Additionally, the context will contain
``object_list`` which holds the filtered queryset.

A legacy functional generic view is still included in django-filter, although
its use is deprecated.  It can be found at
``django_filters.views.object_filter``.  You must provide the same arguments
to it as the class based view::

    # urls.py
    from django.conf.urls import url
    from django_filters.views import object_filter
    from myapp.models import Product

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^list/$', object_filter, {'model': Product}),
    ]

The needed template and its context variables will also be the same as the
class-based view above.
