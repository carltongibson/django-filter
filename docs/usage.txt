Using django-filter
===================

Django-filter provides a simple way to filter down a queryset based on
parameters a user provides.  Say we have a ``Product`` model and we want to let
our users filter which products they see on a list page.

The model
---------

Let's start with our model::

    from django.db import models

    class Product(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        price = models.DecimalField()
        description = models.TextField()
        release_date = models.DateField()
        manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(Manufacturer)

The filter
----------

We have a number of fields and we want to let our users filter based on the
price or the release_date.  We create a ``FilterSet`` for this::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        name = django_filters.CharFilter(lookup_expr='iexact')

        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['price', 'release_date']


As you can see this uses a very similar API to Django's ``ModelForm``.  Just
like with a ``ModelForm`` we can also override filters, or add new ones using a
declarative syntax.

Declaring filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The declarative syntax provides you with the most flexibility when creating
filters, however it is fairly verbose. We'll use the below example to outline
the :ref:`core filter arguments <core-arguments>` on a ``FilterSet``::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        price = django_filters.NumberFilter()
        price__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='price', lookup_expr='gt')
        price__lt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='price', lookup_expr='lt')

        release_year = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='release_date', lookup_expr='year')
        release_year__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='release_date', lookup_expr='year__gt')
        release_year__lt = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='release_date', lookup_expr='year__lt')

        manufacturer__name = django_filters.CharFilter(lookup_expr='icontains')

        class Meta:
            model = Product

There are two main arguments for filters:

- ``name``: The name of the model field to filter on. You can traverse
  "relationship paths" using Django's ``__`` syntax to filter fields on a
  related model. ex, ``manufacturer__name``.
- ``lookup_expr``: The `field lookup`_ to use when filtering. Django's ``__``
  syntax can again be used in order to support lookup transforms.
  ex, ``year__gte``.

.. _`field lookup`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups

Together, the field ``name`` and ``lookup_expr`` represent a complete Django
lookup expression. A detailed explanation of lookup expressions is provided in
Django's `lookup reference`_. django-filter supports expressions containing
both transforms and a final lookup for version 1.9 of Django and above.
For Django version 1.8, transformed expressions are not supported.

.. _`lookup reference`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/lookups/#module-django.db.models.lookups

While both of these fields are optional, it is recommended that you specify
them. By default, if ``name`` is not specified, the filter's name on the
filterset class will be used. Additionally, ``lookup_expr`` defaults to
``exact``. The following is an example of a misconfigured price filter::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        price__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter()

The filter instance will have a field name of ``price__gt`` and an ``exact``
lookup type. Under the hood, this will incorrectly be resolved as::

    Produce.objects.filter(price__gt__exact=value)

.. note::

    It's quite common to forget to set the lookup expression for
    :code:`CharField` and :code:`TextField` and wonder why a search for "foo"
    does not return results for "foobar". This is because the default lookup
    type is `exact`, but you probably want to perform  an `icontains` lookup.

For more information on additional arguments, see :ref:`core-arguments`.


Generating filters with Meta.fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FilterSet Meta class provides a ``fields`` attribute that can be used for
easily specifying multiple filters without significant code duplication. The
base syntax supports a list of multiple field names::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['price', 'release_date']

The above generates 'exact' lookups for both the 'price' and 'release_date'
fields.

Additionally, a dictionary can be used to specify multiple lookup expressions
for each field::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = {
                'price': ['lt', 'gt'],
                'release_date': ['exact', 'year__gt'],
            }

The above would generate 'price__lt', 'price__gt', 'release_date', and
'release_date__year__gt' filters.

.. note::

    The filter lookup type 'exact' is an implicit default and therefore never
    added to a filter name. In the above example, the release date's exact
    filter is 'release_date', not 'release_date__exact'.

Items in the ``fields`` sequence in the ``Meta`` class may include
"relationship paths" using Django's ``__`` syntax to filter on fields on a
related model::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['manufacturer__country']


Overriding default filters
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Like ``django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin``, it is possible to override
default filters for all the models fields of the same kind using
``filter_overrides``::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        filter_overrides = {
            models.CharField: {
                'filter_class': django_filters.CharFilter,
                'extra': lambda f: {
                    'lookup_expr': 'icontains',
                },
            },
            models.BooleanField: {
                'filter_class': django_filters.BooleanFilter,
                'extra': lambda f: {
                    'widget': 'forms.CheckboxInput',
                },
            },
        }

        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = {
                'name': ['exact'],
                'release_date': ['isnull'],
            }


Custom filtering with MethodFilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want fine control over each individual filter attribute, you can use
the ``MethodFilter`` filter.

By passing in the name of a custom defined filter function as an ``action``,
the filter attribute gets linked to the custom filter function.
Here is an example of overriding the filter function of the
filter attribute ``username``
::

    class F(django_filters.FilterSet):
            username = MethodFilter(action='my_custom_filter')

            class Meta:
                model = User
                fields = ['username']

            def my_custom_filter(self, queryset, value):
                return queryset.filter(
                    username=value
                )


The filter function can also be defined outside of the filter class scope.
Though you would need to pass in the actual function value, not it's name.
::

        def my_custom_filter(queryset, value):
            return queryset.filter(
                username=value
            )

        class F(django_filters.FilterSet):
	    # Notice: In this case, action accepts a func, not a string
            username = MethodFilter(action=my_custom_filter)

            class Meta:
                model = User
                fields = ['username']


Lastly, when using a ``MethodFilter``, there is no need to define an action.
You may simply do the following and ``filter_username`` will be auto-detected
and used. ::

        class F(FilterSet):
            username = MethodFilter()

            class Meta:
                model = User
                fields = ['username']

            def filter_username(self, queryset, value):
                return queryset.filter(
                    username__contains='ke'
                )

Under the hood, if ``action`` is not defined, ``django_filter``
searches for a class method with a name that follows the pattern
``filter_{{ATTRIBUTE_NAME}}``. For example, if the attribute name is
``email``, then the filter class will be scanned for the filter function
``filter_email``. If no action is provided, and no filter class
function is found, then the filter attribute will be left unfiltered.


The view
--------

Now we need to write a view::

    def product_list(request):
        f = ProductFilter(request.GET, queryset=Product.objects.all())
        return render(request, 'my_app/template.html', {'filter': f})

If a queryset argument isn't provided then all the items in the default manager
of the model will be used.

If you want to access the filtered objects in your views, for example if you
want to paginate them, you can do that. They are in f.qs


The URL conf
------------

We need a URL pattern to call the view::

    url(r'^list$', views.product_list)


The template
------------

And lastly we need a template::

    {% extends "base.html" %}

    {% block content %}
        <form action="" method="get">
            {{ filter.form.as_p }}
            <input type="submit" />
        </form>
        {% for obj in filter %}
            {{ obj.name }} - ${{ obj.price }}<br />
        {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

And that's all there is to it!  The ``form`` attribute contains a normal
Django form, and when we iterate over the ``FilterSet`` we get the objects in
the resulting queryset.


Generic view  & configuration
-----------------------------

In addition to the above usage there is also a class-based generic view
included in django-filter, which lives at ``django_filters.views.FilterView``.
You must provide either a ``model`` or ``filterset_class`` argument, similar to
``ListView`` in Django itself::

    # urls.py
    from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
    from django_filters.views import FilterView
    from myapp.models import Product

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^list/$', FilterView.as_view(model=Product)),
    )

You must provide a template at ``<app>/<model>_filter.html`` which gets the
context parameter ``filter``.  Additionally, the context will contain
``object_list`` which holds the filtered queryset.

A legacy functional generic view is still included in django-filter, although
its use is deprecated.  It can be found at
``django_filters.views.object_filter``.  You must provide the same arguments
to it as the class based view::

    # urls.py
    from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
    from myapp.models import Product

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^list/$', 'django_filters.views.object_filter', {'model': Product}),
    )

The needed template and its context variables will also be the same as the
class-based view above.
