FilterSet Guide
===============

This document provides a guide on using additional FilterSet features.

Meta options
------------

- :ref:`model <model>`
- :ref:`fields <fields>`
- :ref:`exclude <exclude>`
- :ref:`order_by <order-by>`
- :ref:`form <form>`
- :ref:`together <together>`
- filter_overrides
- :ref:`strict <strict>`


.. _model:

Automatic filter generation with ``model``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``FilterSet`` is capable of automatically generating filters for a given
``model``'s fields. Similar to Django's ``ModelForm``, filters are created
based on the underlying model field's type. This option must be combined with
either the ``fields`` or ``exclude`` option, which is the same requirement for
Django's ``ModelForm`` class, detailed `here`__.

__ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/modelforms/#selecting-the-fields-to-use

.. code-block:: python

    class UserFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = User
            fields = ['username', 'last_login']


.. _fields:

Declaring filterable ``fields``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``fields`` option is combined with ``model`` to automatically generate
filters. Note that generated filters will not overwrite filters declared on
the ``FilterSet``. The ``fields`` option accepts two syntaxes:

* a list of field names
* a dictionary of field names mapped to a list of lookups

.. code-block:: python

    class UserFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = User
            fields = ['username', 'last_login']

    # or

    class UserFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = User
            fields = {
                'username': ['exact', 'contains'],
                'last_login': ['exact', 'year__gt'],
            }

The list syntax will create an ``exact`` lookup filter for each field included
in ``fields``. The dictionary syntax will create a filter for each lookup
expression declared for its corresponding model field. These expressions may
include both transforms and lookups, as detailed in the `lookup reference`__.

.. _exclude:

Disable filter fields with ``exclude``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``exclude`` option accepts a blacklist of field names to exclude from
automatic filter generation. Note that this option will not disable filters
declared directly  on the ``FilterSet``.

.. code-block:: python

    class UserFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = User
            exclude = ['password']


.. _order-by:

Ordering using ``order_by``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can allow the user to control ordering by providing the
``order_by`` argument in the Filter's Meta class.  ``order_by`` can be either a
``list`` or ``tuple`` of field names, in which case those are the options, or
it can be a ``bool`` which, if True, indicates that all fields that
the user can filter on can also be sorted on. An example of ordering using a list::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        price = django_filters.NumberFilter(lookup_expr='lt')
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['price', 'release_date']
            order_by = ['price']

If you want to control the display of items in ``order_by``, you can set it to
a list or tuple of 2-tuples in the format ``(field_name, display_name)``.
This lets you override the displayed names for your ordering fields::

    order_by = (
        ('name', 'Company Name'),
        ('average_rating', 'Stars'),
    )

Note that the default query parameter name used for ordering is ``o``.  You
can override this by setting an ``order_by_field`` attribute on the
``FilterSet``'s Meta class to the string value you would like to use.


.. _form:

Custom Forms using ``form``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inner ``Meta`` class also takes an optional ``form`` argument.  This is a
form class from which ``FilterSet.form`` will subclass.  This works similar to
the ``form`` option on a ``ModelAdmin.``


.. _together:

Group fields with ``together``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inner ``Meta`` class also takes an optional ``together`` argument.  This
is a list of lists, each containing field names. For convenience can be a
single list/tuple when dealing with a single set of fields. Fields within a
field set must either be all or none present in the request for
``FilterSet.form`` to be valid::

    import django_filters

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['price', 'release_date', 'rating']
            together = ['rating', 'price']

.. _strict:

``strict``
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``strict`` option controls whether results are returned when an invalid
value is specified by the user for any filter field. By default, ``strict`` is
set to ``STRICTNESS.RETURN_NO_RESULTS`` meaning that an empty queryset is
returned if any field contains an invalid value. You can loosen this behavior
by setting ``strict`` to ``STRICTNESS.IGNORE`` which will effectively ignore a
filter field if its value is invalid. A third option of
``STRICTNESS.RAISE_VALIDATION_ERROR`` will cause a ``ValidationError`` to be
raised if any field contains an invalid value.

Overriding ``FilterSet`` methods
--------------------------------

``filter_for_lookup()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to version 0.13.0, filter generation did not take into account the
``lookup_expr`` used. This commonly caused malformed filters to be generated
for 'isnull', 'in', and 'range' lookups (as well as transformed lookups). The
current implementation provides the following behavior:

- 'isnull' lookups return a ``BooleanFilter``
- 'in' lookups return a filter derived from the CSV-based ``BaseInFilter``.
- 'range' lookups return a filter derived from the CSV-based ``BaseRangeFilter``.

If you want to override the ``filter_class`` and ``params`` used to instantiate
filters for a model field, you can override ``filter_for_lookup()``. Ex::

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = {
                'release_date': ['exact', 'range'],
            }

        @classmethod
        def filter_for_lookup(cls, f, lookup_type):
            # override date range lookups
            if isinstance(f, models.DateField) and lookup_type == 'range':
                return django_filters.DateRangeFiler, {}

            # use default behavior otherwise
            return super(ProductFilter, cls).filter_for_lookup(f, lookup_type)


``get_ordering_field()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use a custom widget, or in any other way override the ordering
field you can override the ``get_ordering_field()`` method on a ``FilterSet``.
This method just needs to return a Form Field.

Ordering on multiple fields, or other complex orderings can be achieved by
overriding the ``FilterSet.get_order_by()`` method. This is passed the selected
``order_by`` value, and is expected to return an iterable of values to pass to
``QuerySet.order_by``. For example, to sort a ``User`` table by last name, then
first name::

    class UserFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        class Meta:
            order_by = (
                ('username', 'Username'),
                ('last_name', 'Last Name')
            )

        def get_order_by(self, order_value):
            if order_value == 'last_name':
                return ['last_name', 'first_name']
            return super(UserFilter, self).get_order_by(order_value)
