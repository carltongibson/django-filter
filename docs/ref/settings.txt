==================
Available Settings
==================

Here is a list of all available settings of django-filters and their
default values. All settings are prefixed with ``FILTERS_``, although this
is a bit verbose it helps to make it easy to identify these settings.


FILTERS_HELP_TEXT_EXCLUDE
-------------------------

Default: ``True``

Enable / disable the default field ``help_text`` on filters where ``exclude=True`` (:doc:`/ref/filters`). This does not affect fields which explicitly define ``help_text``.

.. note:: This setting is pending deprecation.

FILTERS_HELP_TEXT_FILTER
------------------------

Default: ``True``

Enable / disable the default field ``help_text`` on filters where ``exclude=False`` (:doc:`/ref/filters`). This does not affect fields which explicitly define ``help_text``.

.. note:: This setting is pending deprecation.
